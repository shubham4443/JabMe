# FAQs
## 1. What is the purpose of this project?
We don't easily get slots on the CoWIN website. Most of the time they are already booked. We have to keep clicking on the search button in order to continuously track for slot availability. This project helps to eliminate the need for continuously clicking on the search button in hopes of getting a free slot. 

## 2. How it works?
Just enter either your pincode or state and district and the site will give you instant notification whenever it detects an availability. Note that to receive notification you have to keep the site open.

## 3. How will I recieve the notification?
This site will make a bell like sound whenever an availability is detected. We suggest you to also keep cowin site open in order to immediately book the slot.

## 4. Is my personal data collected?
No we do not collect any personal data from the user. This site remains 100% transparent. Any queries contact the developer on github.
